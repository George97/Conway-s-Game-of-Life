Conway’s ”Game of Life”
Requirements:  Propose the way to implement Conway`s Game of Life. It is a cellular automaton which simulate behavior of alive organisms. The Game as input data has initial set of organisms (seed) to which at each step in time next rules are applied:
1.	 Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2.	Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3.	Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.	Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
These rules are applied to each cell simultaneously for some period of time (tick) and as result at each step we receive new generation of cells.
